# Word-Analyzer
The program analyzes the dictionary file that contains 1000 words (each word has 200 vectors value), text file (for ex: a book), and ignored_words file. If the word that is given as an input is not found in the text file, the program finds the closest word(according to the distance between vectors) to the input in the dictionary file. According to these analysis, the program draws a histogram for each input.
